Once upon a time there was a beautiful princess who lived in a cold, dark land far far away. #Chicago #Windycity #TheAirHurtsMyFace.
The princess was trapped in a castle, protected by a spell of which only could be broken by reciting the magic words.
Many had tried to reach the princess but thus far none succeeded, for you see, the Indiana toll road was a brutal journey few could face.
 
It wasn't until the tale of the princess' beauty and grace crossed the ears of a brave young bear.
The bear knew the young maiden was in dire need of rescuing and he vowed not to rest until she was free.
This is where the bears journey begins.
